analyze what needs to be done (feature tracker)
analyze what needs to get fixed (bug tracker)

some things that need to be done:

web portal:
- write e.g. Mechanize::WWW tests for web interaction testing
- write a proper request querying interface
  + design a proper way to indicate content-type in the JSON responses (e.g. so that sniffer traces are displayed properly without "magic")
- 

documentation:
- cleanup and aggregate all the little pieces of documentation scattered
  all over the place.
