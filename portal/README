The "portal" provided here is a an interface between HTTP/HTTPS and a
REST/JSON "forms" interface provided by the "api" service.

Specifically the "portal" handles:
- user registration
- user authentication
- authorization
- session management
- forms presentation and submission (including field validation)
- I18N/L10N

The "portal" would also provide any AJAX/DHTML features, and proxy API
operations to the back-end (including proper field validation and
authorization).

The "api" service in turn offers a "forms" interface which provides:
- "blank forms"
- "pre-filled forms" (using a specified key/id)
- "form submission"
