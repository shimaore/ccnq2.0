Provisioning:
  (1) normalize the request
  (2) authorize the request
  (3) break down a single Request into individual, possibly inter-dependent, Activities

  Activities include the creation of a billing event

  A request is completed when all its descendents are completed.
  A request can only be deleted if all its descendents are new.


Activity queueing and distribution:

  See slide 2 of Architecture.odg for activity lifecycle
