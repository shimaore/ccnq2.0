In CCNQ::Rating:

  Steps in the rating process:

  CBEF as received:

    start_date
    start_time
    account
    account_sub
    event_type

  Numbers:

    from_e164
    to_e164       destination number, or more generally, which number this relates to

  [Note: more generically, there would be a "numbers" fields with entries in it.]

  Spent units:

    event_count
    duration

  [Note: more generically, there would be a "spent" field with {value,unit} pairs in it.]

  Plus the following CBEF elements which are generally not used for rating:

    timestamp
    collecting_node
    event_description
    request_uuid







  event_types:
    connected_inbound_call
    connected_outbound_call
    connected_onnet_call
    failed_inbound_call   # not needed; set count to 0 (see CCNQ::Rating::Event)
    failed_outbound_call
    failed_onnet_call
    sms
    dids_in_use
    activated_did # On the first day of use.

  rate_tables (examples):
    sms:free-week-ends+1000-free-monthly+6c-extra


  filter(event) =>
    rate_table
    category+subcategory

  bucket = per subcategories (can aggregate many)

  category: e.g. voice alls, SMS, internet connection
    sub_category: e.g. week-end SMS, etc.
    -> maintain buckets per sub_category + unit types

  rates:
    essentially a duration is first converted (once the rate is determined)
    into a billable_base (based on call minimum duration) + billable_count





In CCNQ::Rating::Table:

  # Generally speaking, a given rating table will provide two values for each
  # lookup:
  #   a per_unit value, provided by the table's data
  #   a unit name, which is part of the table's metadata (and therefor shared by all values)
  # Examples of "unit" names:
  #    billing_period       for rates stored per period (e.g. to account for partial month billing of a DID)
  #    minute               for rates stored per minute (as is normally the case for duration-based rates)
