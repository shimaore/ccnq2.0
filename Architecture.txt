Components:

Core:
A = Carrier-facing SBCs (FS)
B = Inbound routing (OSips)
C = Outbound routing (OSips)

Customer interface:
D = Direct-connect customer-facing SBCs (FS)
E = Customer-facing Feature Engine (FS)
F = Customer-facing routing (OSips)
G = Registrar (OSips)
H = Media-Proxy (MP)



1. Carrier-facing SBCs (signalling-only FS: late-neg, etc.)
   With static configuration & firewall
   Issues:
   - codec negotiation is no longer transparent
   - some call flows not properly supported by FS
   Optionally: allow for remote configuration of carriers (needs FS + Fw config)

2. All routing is DNS-based
   Therefor: need DB-based DNS, or DNS reconfig toolset

3. Registrar uses OSips 1.5 features for relay of REGISTER, 302 for routing

*. All routing is domain-based
4. Routing towards customers: all routing via aliases
5. Routing towards internal: all routing via trunk DNS routing




Deliverables:
. Debian distribution with everything included
. Custom packages for configuration, monitoring, ...
. Testing, testing automation, ..



OpenSIPS particulars:
- we're now using _domains_ for all operations.


- use DROUTING as the routing engine for the outbound-proxy?
