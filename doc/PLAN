some things that need to be done:

web portal:
- write e.g. Mechanize::WWW tests for web interaction testing
- write a proper request querying interface
  + design a proper way to indicate content-type in the JSON responses (e.g. so that sniffer traces are displayed properly without "magic")
- 

documentation:
- cleanup and aggregate all the little pieces of documentation scattered
  all over the place.

Dynamic ENUM -- PowerDNS
IPv6:
  - IPv6 in OpenSIPS
  - IPv6 in MediaProxy
  - IPv6 in FreeSwitch
Have per-trunk expiration dates -- e.g. to automatically implement "test until" dates
Emergency calls monitoring -- alerts, etc.
