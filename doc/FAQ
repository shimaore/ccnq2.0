=head2 I get the following error when starting ccnq2_xmpp_agent manually:
parser error: Can't call method "NamespaceEnd" on an undefined value at /usr/lib/perl5/XML/Parser/Expat.pm line 614.
 on [<failure xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'><not-authorized/></failure>]

This indicates that the connection with the XMPP server was closed intempestively.
Make sure you have registerd the proper user and password combination on your Jabber server.

=head2 I get the following error when starting ccnq2_xmpp_agent manually:
parser error: Can't call method "NamespaceEnd" on an undefined value at /usr/lib/perl5/XML/Parser/Expat.pm line 614.
 on [<stream:error><conflict xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'/><text xml:lang='en' xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-streams'>Replaced by new connection</text></stream:error></stream:stream>]

This indicates either that a ccnq2_xmpp_agent is already running for this host.
Make sure you only have one ccnq2_xmpp_agent running per host.

This might also indicate that you forgot to bump the number of concurrent connections a single client can have with your Jabber server.
In this case run for example
   sed -i -e 's/^{access, max_user_sessions, \[{10, all}\]}\./{access, max_user_sessions, [{20, all}]}./' /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg
(or edit the ejabberd.cfg file) to bring the number of max_user_sessions to a value that matches your use of the system.

This finally might indicate that you have two identical services running for the same host and same cluster.
A host can belong to multiple clusters; however if you put multiple services inside the same cluster (for example a proxy and a SBC service),
the system won't be able to differentiate common service (specifically host-based service such as monit, etc.).
In this case you need to split the service amongst two clusters and re-configure the host to belong to both clusters.
