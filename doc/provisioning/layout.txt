This document specifies minimum record layout for data stored in the
provisioning database.

Generally speaking, records in the provisioning database should contain
full requests as received by the application's business logic.

Note: The manager/request associated with base CCNQ::Proxy::$action will eventually disappear since they are redundant.

** Records

The following fields are common (so that we can build views):

  _id: $type/$$type
  account: $account_id
  account_sub: $account_sub_id
  type: $type
      indicates that this record can be re-submitted via manager-request "$type".
      (auto-populated by node/api)

* "number" type:

  Allows to re-create the complete routing (in & out) for a given number.
  Includes mapping the number to a customer endpoint.

* "endpoint" type:

  Allows to re-create a customer endpoint.
  Including mapping it to location information.

* "location" type:

  Provides information about a customer location, used especially for emergency location.

** Views

  type: $type    --- indicates that this record can be re-submitted via manager-request "$type".
  description: $description  -- plain text description of the type of routing entry
