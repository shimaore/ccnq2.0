This document specifies minimum record layout for data stored in the
provisioning database.

Generally speaking, records in the provisioning database should contain
full requests as received by the application's business logic.

*** Routing configuration

Note: The manager/request associated with base CCNQ::Proxy::$action will eventually disappear since they are redundant.

The following fields are common (so that we can build views):

  account: $account_id
  account_sub: $account_sub_id

  number: $number
  endpoint: $endpoint

Also the following fields are used

  type: $type    --- indicates that this record can be re-submitted via manager-request "$type".
  description: $description  -- plain text description of the type of routing entry
