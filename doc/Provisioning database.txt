CouchDB provisioning database

The provisioning information is kept in a single CouchDB database.
The CouchDB database is co-located with the API nodes.
(The Request/Activity database is co-located with the manager node and is independent.)

The IDs are randomly assigned by CouchDB.
View are used to locate elements in the database.

The views are for example:

by/account      key: ["account",$account]
by/account_sub  key: ["account_sub",$account,$account_sub]
by/user         key: ["user",$user_id]
