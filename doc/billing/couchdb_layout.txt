This document specifies record layout for data stored in the billing
database.

**** Billing information ****

This information is updated via the API/Manager subsystem in order to
process unrated CBEF (CDRs) and generate rated CBEFs.

user_profile

  _id: "user/${user_id}"
  type: "user_profile"

  name: $user_name
  email: $user_email
  billing_accounts: [ ${account_id}, .. ]

  Notes:
  "billing_accounts" lists the accounts which this portal user will
  receive invoices for.

  Other information such as access levels (portal_accounts, pricing
  access, which operations are available to which users, ..), passwords,
  etc. are managed directly by the portal front-end and are not stored
  in the provisioning database.

  _id: "account/${account_id}"
  type: "account_profile"

  name: $account_name
  billing_address: { }
  billing_cycle: $billing_cycle

account_sub_profile:

  _id: "account/${account_id}/${account_sub_id}"
  type: "account_sub_profile"

  name: $account_sub_name (as printed on bill)
  plan: ${plan_id}  (reference to "plan/${plan_id}" document)

plan_profile:

  rating: [ { name: $name, guards: [ ... ], actions: [ ... ] },
            { name: $name, guards: [ ... ], actions: [ ... ] },
            ...
          ]

  Notes:
  guards are [ $guard_name, @guard_params ]
  actions are [ $action_name, @action_params ]

  $guard_name and $action_name are specified in CCNQ::Rating::Rate

bucket:
  _id: "bucket/${name}"
  type: "bucket_profile"

  name: ${name}
  decimals: ${decimals}
  increment: ${increment}

  The bucket is duration (seconds) -based iff currency is not present/defined.

  _id: "rating_table/${table_name}"
  type: "rating_table"

  rows: [
          { prefix: $prefix, ... },
          ...
        ]

rating_table/e164_to_location

  This is a prefix-based rating table that provides location information
  for any number. The rows content is as follows:

    prefix: E.164 without a "+" sign
    country: $country_name
    us_state: $us_state (if $country_name is "us")

  (See CCNQ::Rating::Event::Numbers in CCNQ/Rating/Events.pm.)


**** Rated CDRs storage ****

Rated CDRs are stored in a separate (large) CouchDB database which provides
views for CDR summarization.
