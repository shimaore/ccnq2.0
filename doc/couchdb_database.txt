This document describes the different databases used by the platform.
This includes the databases used on the SIP platform up to the API, but
not the database(s) used by the portal.

This document is up-to-date as of 2010-04-09.


provisioning
  - used to store copy of the latest manager request for a given entity
  - entity types managed at this time include: number, endpoint, location
  - distributed / replicatable: a local copy of the database is used

billing
  - used to store billing-related meta-data
  - distributed / replicatable: a local copy of the database is used

cdr
  - used to store call details
  - can be distributed, but is currently unique (direct remote CouchDB access)
    (needs aggregation code to become distributable)

bucket
  - store values (but not meta-data) for buckets
  - must be unique (direct remote CouchDB access)



Usage examples:

* The [realtime_estimator] process uses (a local copy of) the billing database,
  and the (global) bucket database, to compute information about a call,

    [realtime_estimator]  <------  billing db (local copy)
            ^
            |
        bucket db

* The [rating] process uses (a local copy of) the billing database, and the
  (global) bucket database, to transform an unrated CBEF into a rated CDR,
  and send it to the (global) cdr database.

    billing_entry()  --> [rating]   <----  billing db (local copy)
                            |
                            v
                           cdr db

* The [provisioning_update] or [billing_update] process updates many local
  copies of the respective databases, via the XMPP bus.

   [provisioning_update] --> XMPP bus -->  provisioning db
                                      -->  provisioning db
