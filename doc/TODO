* split the "_install" code so that it only contains configuration statement
  * add a new "_restart" code that restarts the voice-handling processes
  * ccnq2_upgrade(_all) only does reconfiguration (but now includes calling ccnq2_upgrade even without -f); add ccnq2_restart(_all)
  * the "-f" option calls ccnq2_restart_all
* modify OpenSIPS code so that:
  it strips transport= from RURI
  it strips maddr= from RURI
* import rating tables
* create/manage buckets
* code for cfa/cfb
* FS code for feature-server / redirection server
* FS code for prepaid (realtime_estimator)
* API: get CDRs
* end-of-month processing (including partial days)
* daily crontab (e.g. import number of DIDs for partial month counts)
  .. e.g.: generate a CDR for number of numbers / endpoints / locations per account_sub ?
* emergency call routing
* CDR + cost analysis on carrier SBC
  - collect CDRs
  - do rating analysis (private plans)
* generalize form validation: generic Perl validation code + AJAX validation
