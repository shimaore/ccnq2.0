This is the sepcification for the API service which allows an external
process (e.g. portal) to query or update data inside the system.

The code for the API service is located in ${SRC}/node/api/actions .

The API service is located at a "well-known" contact point specified as

  CCNQ::Install::api_rendezvous_host      '127.0.0.1'
  CCNQ::Install::api_rendezvous_port      9090

Note that the API service is therefor normally not reachable from
outside an "api"-type node, which is why "api" and "portal" types
must be co-located. (Eventually this restriction will be lifted.)

-- Creating a new Request --

New requests are inserted into the system using

  /api/${action}/${cluster_name}

This type of request is sent over to the "manager" process which then
uses the logic in ${SRC}/manager/actions to dispatch the Request into
one or more Activities.

The ${action} must be one of actions specified in

  ${SRC}/manager/requests/${action}_query.pm    for GET
  ${SRC}/manager/requests/${action}_update.pm   for PUT
  ${SRC}/manager/requests/${action}_delete.pm   for DELETE

The response is a JSON hash containing at least the following:

  {
    request => ${request_id}
  }

Note that since GET queries do not return immediately (they merely
create a new request for data in the system), other API services are
available to query data in a more real-time fashion.

-- Tracking a Request --

The following API service provides information about the status of
requests.

  /request/${request_id}      (GET)

-- Querying the provisioning database --

The following API service allows to query the provisioning database
directly.

  /provisioning/...         XXX
