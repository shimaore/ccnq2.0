Prerequisites:
- a database server; the configuration scripts are written for MySQL
  but could be easily modified for PostgreSQL.
    aptitude install mysql-server
- a web server; I use lighttpd but any server that can handle .pl files
  as CGI will do.
		aptitude install lighttpd
- Perl's JSON library:
    aptitude install libjson-perl

Note: personally I add:
  aptitude --purge remove portmap
  aptitude install postfix

Installing the code:

	aptitude install git-core
	mkdir ~/src && (cd ~/src && git clone git://github.com/stephanealnet/ccnq2.0.git)
	mkdir ~/bin && cp ~/src/ccnq2.0/bin/upgrade.sh ~/bin/
	# Edit ~/bin/upgrade.sh to your liking
	~/bin/upgrade.sh
	# cd /var/www && cp configuration.pm.orig configuration.pm
	# Edit configuration.pm to your liking
	# Edit /etc/default/opensips.cfg to enable OpenSIPS
	~/bin/upgrade.sh

Also:
- Make sure the user running the web server (e.g. user www-data) is in the group
  that has access to the OpenSIPS FIFO (e.g. group opensips) so that the code
  can issue MI commands.
