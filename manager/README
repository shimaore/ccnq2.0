The manager is an XMPP robot which receives individual Requests and
converts them into individual Activities, which are then submitted to
the proper XMPP agents (generally via MUC rooms).

The manager processes different message types:

  Request:

    Requests are generated with a unique identifier.

  Activity:
    Each request might contain one or more activities; activities are
    tried sequentially and are identified by their parent request ID
    followed by a sequential number.

  Responses:

    Responses received from hosts for each activity are stored individually
    and identified by the related activity's identifier, followed by the
    respondent's host name.

All messages are logged into a database which can be queried to retrieve
status information about requests and activities.
