The Lua script itself should be kept short.

What I need to do is create a web interface that implements the call rating
(and therefor hides the Trie, etc. behind an API).

Also the billing rules (under CCNQ::Rating::Rate) should be flexible enough to be
able to be used for multiple modes:
- evaluate the cost of a call knowing its duration (normal post-pay billing mode)
- evaluate the maximum duration of a call knowing how much money is available (pre-pay mode)
- determine whether a call is free or chargeable
- determine a per-minute rate applicable to the call
