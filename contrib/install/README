These scripts are used during the initial installation of the different servers.
They provide automated copy and execution of scripts on remote servers using scp/ssh.

On your management system you should install the file in etc/ccn/servers as /etc/ccn/servers,
and update it to reflect your local settings. (This file plays the same role as the file found
in contrib/manage/etc/ccn/servers.)

The set of scripts in the "bin" directory are meant to be used the following way (for example):

  cd bin
  ./run-all.sh ntp
  SERVERS="sbc1 scb2" ./run-all.sh freeswitch

(Notice how you can run a given script only on a subset of servers using the syntax in the last
example.)
