# This is a script I use in order to automatically update the configuration

# Usage: upgrade-all.sh [-q|-f]
#  -q: quick -- only do git pull and restart xmpp-agent
#  -f: force -- reconfigure and restart the call processing nodes
#  no option: like -q but adds backup of /etc
#

# /etc/ccn/servers should
#    export SERVERS="server1 server2 ..."
# with all servers.
