[Relay]
; A list of dispatchers to connect to, separated by spaces. The format is
; "host[:port] [host[:port] ...]". If a port is not specified the default port
; of 25060 will be used. "host" can be one of the following:
;  - A domain name that has a SRV record for a SIP proxy, i.e. at
;    "_sip._udp.<domain>". If the DNS lookup for this succeeds the relay
;    will connect to the IP address of the SIP proxy on the port specified in
;    this configuration.
;  - A hostname. The lookup for this will be performed if the SRV lookup
;    fails.
;  - An IP address. The relay will connect directly to this address.
;  Both the SRV and hostname lookups will be periodically refreshed (see
;  "dns_check_interval" below).
;
;dispatchers = ${cluster_name}.${domain_name}

; Specify extra checks to be performed on the dispatcher TLS credentials before
; considering the connection with the dispatcher succesful. The passport is
; specified as a list of attribute/value pairs in the form:
;   AN:value[, AN:value...]
; where the attribute name (AN) is one of the available attribute names from
; the X509 certificate subject: O, OU, CN, C, L, ST, EMAIL. The value is a
; string that has to match with the corresponding attribute value from the
; dispatcher certificate. A wildcard (*) can be used in the value at the
; beginning or the end of the string to indicate that the corresponding
; attribute from the dispatcher certificate must end with respectively to
; start with the given string (excluding the wildcard).
; For example using this passport:
;   passport = O:AG Projects, CN:*dispatcher
; means that a connection with a dispatcher will only be accepted if the
; dispatcher certificate subject has organization set to "AG Projects" and
; the common name ends with "dispatcher". To specify that no additional
; identity checks need to be performed, use the keyword None. If passport
; is None, then only the certificate signature is verified agains the
; certificate authority in tls/ca.pem (signature is always verified even
; when passport is None).
;
; Default value is None.
;
;passport = None

; The host IP address used for relaying streams. The default for this value
; is to use the IP address of the interface that has the default route. This
; is the most appropriate choice for almost any situation. Unless you need to
; use a very specific interface, which is not the default one, there is no need
; to set this option. Leave this option commented to use the default value.
;relay_ip = <default host IP>

; The port range to use for relaying media streams in the form start:end with
; start and end being even numbers in the [1024, 65536] range and start < end
; The default range is 50000:60000. You should allocate 4 times the number of
; streams you plan for the relay to handle simultaneously. The default range
; having 10000 ports, is able to handle up to 2500 streams.
;
port_range = 40000:41998

; The minimum level log messages need to have in order to appear in syslog
; or on the console, depending on the mode the relay is running in.
; In order of severity, this can be one of CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or
; DEBUG.
;log_level = DEBUG

; The amount of time to wait for a stream in a new SDP offer to start sending
; data before the relay decides that it has timed out. The default value is 90
; seconds. This only applies to the initial setup stage, before the first
; packet for a stream is received (from both ends). After the stream is started
; and the conntrack rule is in place, the idle timeout (how long before the
; conntrack rule expires when no traffic is received) is controlled by a kernel
; setting that defaults to 180 seconds and can be adjusted in:
;     /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_udp_timeout_stream
;
;stream_timeout = 90

; Amount of time a call can be on hold before it is declared expired by the
; relay. The default value is 7200 seconds (2 hours).
;
;on_hold_timeout = 7200

; How often to check in DNS if the SRV and A records for the dispatcher have
; changed. Interval is in seconds and the default value is 60 seconds.
;
;dns_check_interval = 60

; If the relay cannot connect to a dispatcher is should retry after this
; amount of seconds. The default value is 10 seconds.
;
;reconnect_delay = 10

; How often to sample the aggregate ammount of data processed by the relay, in
; order to compute an average of the relayed traffic over that period. The
; value is expressed in seconds and the default value is 15 seconds.
; Use 0 to disable it in case you have to many streams processed by the relay
; and it warns you in syslog that gathering this information takes too long.
