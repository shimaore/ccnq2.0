use Tree::Trie;






format:

date time account 

elements:

create cnam
modify cnam
delete cnam
create 911
modify 911
delete 911
etc.

+ every day, report on elements which are present:

DIDs
TFs
0810
etc. (per category -- category is assigned in DB when element is created)

then add them for the month (meaning we can do partial-month billing on dids)
