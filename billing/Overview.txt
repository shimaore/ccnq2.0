Provisioning:
  (1) normalize the request
  (2) authorize the request
  (3) break down a single Request into individual, possibly inter-dependent, Activities

  Activities include the creation of a billing event

  A request is completed when all its descendents are completed.
  A request can only be deleted if all its descendents are new.


Activity queueing and distribution:

  See slide 2 of Architecture.odg for activity lifecycle




Common Billing Element Format (CBEF)

  All CDRs, logs, and activity-based events are aggregated.
  The aggregated files are classified by type (e.g. FreeSwitch CDRs, etc.) and then fed to different Mediation processors based on their content.
  There is a Null Mediation processor for records which are already in CBEF format.

  The Billing Elements are then fed into the Rating engine (using the CBEF format).

  The file format is tab-delimited UTF-8 data. The first line in each file is used to indicate the fields names.
  (If a Mediation processor doesn't know which fields will be needed, it should provide all the fields it knows about.)
  If a field is empty (two tabs around it) it is treated as undefined/unassigned (i.e. the empty string is not valid content).

* start_date            YYYYMMDD (local time)
* start_time            HHMMSS   (local time)
* timestamp             (unix epoch-based timestamp, used for correlation with e.g. logs)
* collecting_node       (DNS, IP, or other name for the node that collected the element)

* account               (opaque account number)
  account_sub           (opaque sub account, e.g. SIP trunk ID)
* event_type            (opaque event type; the "element rates and conditions" DB will provide information on how to handle it)
  event_description     (plain-text description of the event that caused the Element to be created)
  request_uuid          (uuid of the Request that created the Element)

    For all events we collect an event count:
  count           number of events (e.g. number of SMS, number of Mo transfered, etc.)
                  normally "1" for duration-based events

    For calls we need to collect the following information:
  duration        duration in seconds (zero duration might mean failed call)
  from_e164       +....
  to_e164         +....

    The Rating engine will locate the following information in the ERC-DB for each number involved in a call
    (i.e. from and to, mostly); the actual field names are "from_label", etc.:

  _label          a "human readable" label for the number
  _country        country of the number
  _state          state of the number (used for US intra- vs inter-state billing)

    Additionally, calling/called tax jurisdictions might be located at that time.

    At this point extra parameters are computed in order to locate a proper rate for the call.
    For example:

  intrastate
  interstate
  distance
  time_of_day_rule

    A "rate" is a set of filters and a set of parameters. A filter will map a given call into a unique rating table
    which will provide the proper parameters for the call.

    Filters:
      time-of-day
      intra-state vs inter-state
      etc.

    Parameters: (these are the values provided in the "rating tables" generated from the ERC-DB)

  currency
  initial_duration
  initial_cost
  additional_duration
  additional_cost
  count_cost

    Additionally, tax jurisdictions might be located inside the parameters.

    The following values are then computed:

  billable_count      for countable events
  billable_duration   for duration-based events

    The Rating engine does billing at the account_sub level (e.g. contract), if available.
    It will use the rules in the ERC-DB in order to build a new file which will provide for each element the following additional information:

  currency              USD, EUR, etc.
  amount                (standard float with . decimal separator)
  tax_count             (how many tax_rate and tax_amount)
  tax_jurisdiction_1    (opaque jurisdiction reference or name)
  tax_rate_1            (in %)
  tax_amount_1          (in currency)
  tax_jurisdiction_2    (...)
  tax_rate_2            (in %)
   (etc.)

   The Rating engine might generate 0 amount records if (e.g.) the call is included in a plan, or is a toll-free call.
